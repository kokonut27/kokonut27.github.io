            <p class="member-box-text-rework-responsive">I am a microbiologist interested in discovering how pathogenic microbial organisms utilize diverse tools to exploit and evade innate and adaptive immune defense mechanisms to survive in different environments, such as mammalian hosts and arthropod vectors. I enjoy reading historical original research articles with hand-drawn figures and tables! In these articles, the authors show unmatched inspiration for science, in-depth insights into discovering unknowns, and far-reaching visions that continue to impact multiple aspects of science, even after decades of the initial discovery. I also enjoy reading scientific thriller books, playing video and board games, and traveling (realizing that I have not done much of these in recent years...sigh...).</p>

My first research project investigated the pi-stacking interactions between amyloid proteins that are hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease. After studying drug design/delivery tailored to amyloid aggregation, I was able to synthesize a drug candidate that reversed the aggregation effects in vitro. Thanks to this project, MIT named a <a class="link" href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/sbdb_lookup.html#/?sstr=29655" target="_blank">minor planet</a> after me! I received my Bachelor's in Biology at Columbia and my Master's in Biomedical Research Technologies at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. I am currently aspiring to pursue research in the context of medicine, because translating research done on the benchtop to the patient's bedside is my passion and goal. Due to my background in protein biochemistry (specifically protein aggregation), I am eager to study this phenomenon in any cellular context, as I believe investigating different perspectives can bring answers to our scientific questions. I hope to aid the Kim Lab's efforts to unravel the molecular, genetic, and pathologic mysteries behind Tickborne Rickettsial Disease.
