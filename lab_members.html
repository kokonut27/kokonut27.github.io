      <h3> Principal Investigator </h3>
      <div>
        <img src="media/hwan.jpg" style="max-width: 220px;">
        <ul>
          <li><u>Hwan Kim Ph.D.</u></li>
          <li style="overflow: hidden;">I am a microbiologist by training at the University of Chicago and Howard T. Ricketts Laboratory (many thanks to Drs. Schneewind and Missiakas!). I enjoy working with pathogenic microbial organisms and understanding various aspects of pathogenesis, immune evasion mechanisms, host immunity, and host-pathogen-vector interactions. I hope that our research provides insights into the development of vaccines and therapeutics for microbial pathogens of public health importance. Outside the laboratory, I enjoy eating delicious Asian food, reading science fiction books, playing video games with my sons, and watching superhero movies with my wife.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Research Assistant Professor</h3>
      <div>
        <img src="media/ilia.jpg" style="max-width: 220px; max-height: 160px;">
        <ul>
          <li><u>Ilia Rochlin Ph.D., Center for Infectious Diseases</u></li>
          <li style="overflow: hidden;">I was trained as an entomologist and epidemiologist at Cornell University and Touro College, respectively. I have worked at various capacities as a bacteriologist through laboratory director for state and local public health agencies investigating mosquito and tick-borne diseases within the eco-epidemiological framework as a complex system of interacting environmental, social, and biological factors. My work has encompassed a broad range of subjects from molecular biology and virology to entomology, ecology, and sociology. The common denominator among these diverse interests is the focus on public health driven by a quantitative approach and statistical modeling. My professional interests overlap with my long standing fascination with "old fashioned" natural history and pursuits in macrophotography.<br></br>E-mail: <a class="link">ilia.rochlin at stonybrook.edu</a></li>

      <h3>Postdoctoral Associate</h3>
      <div>
        <img src="media/cody.png" style="max-width: 220px;">
        <ul>
          <li><u>Cody Kempen, Ph.D., Co-mentored under Dr. Pawan Kumar</u></li>
          <li style="overflow: hidden;">During my doctoral studies, I was trained as a mucosal immunologist in the lab of Dr. Pawan Kumar, at Stony Brook University. My dissertation research focused on the role IL-17 signaling to Paneth cells plays in regenerating the intestinal epithelium post irradiation induced injury. Prior to my doctoral studies, I received my MS in Pharmaceutical Sciences at Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences. There, I studied mechanisms of lung epithelial cell death in response to Ricin toxin under the guidance of Dr. Timothy LaRocca. Throughout my scientific career, I have been interested in host responses to injury, toxicity, and infection. My postdoctoral work aims to elucidate the importance of IL-17 and IL-22 signaling during Rickettsia infection. In the future, I hope to build a career teaching and inspiring the next generation of scientific minds. During my free time I enjoy traveling with my wife, watching sports (go NY Giants!), reading fantasy and science fiction novels, and watching movies.</li>

        <ul>
          <li><u>Luke Helminiak, B.S., Molecular Genetics and Microbiology</u></li>
          <li style="overflow: hidden;">I received my B.S. in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry from the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire. I then went and worked at the Next Generation Sequencing Laboratory at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester MN. For my dissertation, I study <em>Rickettsia</em> pathogenesis with a focus on hemolysin secretion and function. Following my graduation, I aim to work on infectious disease diagnostics and have the opportunity to have a direct role in helping patients. Thus, my goal is to work as a Laboratory Director in a clinical microbiology laboratory. I have a love of sports, and enjoy running, basketball, snowboarding, and archery. During my down time, I love listening to music and watching movies.<br></br>E-mail: <a class="link">luke.helminiak at stonybrook.edu</a></li>

        <ul>
          <li><u>Smruti Mishra, M.S., Molecular Genetics and Microbiology</u></li>
          <li style="overflow: hidden;">I am from Bhubaneshwar, India. I did my bachelor’s in Dental Surgery from Pravara Institute of Medical Sciences, India and my MS in Molecular Biosciences from Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences. While at ACPHS I worked in Dr. Meenakshi Malik’s lab using an in vitro bioreactor infection model to study the evolution of daptomycin resistance in methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. For my PhD thesis I am working on understanding the contribution of polysaccharide synthesis operon on tick-borne rickettsiosis as well as its role in shaping host immunity. My research interests lie in the field of bacterial pathogenesis and infectious diseases, specifically in understanding the host-pathogen interactions and molecular mechanisms involved in the same. In my free time I love travelling and exploring new places with my husband and learning to cook new Indian dishes. I enjoy watching movies and dancing as well.<br></br>E-mail: <a class="link">smruti.mishra at stonybrook.edu</a></li>

      <h3> Lab Manager </h3>
      <div style="padding-bottom: 1vh;">
        <img src="media/hara.jpeg" style="max-width: 220px;">
        <ul>
          <li><u>Hara Seo, B.S.</u></li>
          <li style="overflow: hidden;">I have an interesting academic background where I fell in love with Music in my youth but learned the beauty of Chemistry as an undergraduate student. Interestingly, this unusual learning experience helped me raise two little monsters and sourdough starters! Over time, I became a microbiologist by self-teaching about the mysteries of sourdough baking. I started my career as an administrative assistant to the director of Howard T. Ricketts Laboratory at Argonne National Laboratory. Since moving to Stony Brook, I am learning whole new knowledge about tick-borne <em>Rickettsia</em>. I am quite excited about this new journey! And, I enjoy baking, listening music, and spending time with one big and two little monsters.<br></br>E-mail: <a class="link">hara.seo at stonybrook.edu</a></li>

      <h3> Research Technicians </h3>

        <ul>
          <li><u>Yarim Lee, M.S.</u></li>
          <li style="overflow: hidden;">My biggest passion is science research! I have been doing research since high school and have not stopped since. My first research project investigated the pi-stacking interactions between amyloid proteins that are hallmarks of Alzheimer’s Disease. After studying drug design/delivery tailored to amyloid aggregation, I was able to synthesize a drug candidate that reversed the aggregation effects in vitro. Thanks to this project, MIT named a <a class="link" href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/sbdb_lookup.html#/?sstr=29655" target="_blank">minor planet</a> after me! I received my Bachelor’s in Biology at Columbia and my Master’s in Biomedical Research Technologies at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. I am currently aspiring to pursue research in the context of medicine, because translating research done on the benchtop to the patient’s bedside is my passion and goal. Due to my background in protein biochemistry (specifically protein aggregation), I am eager to study this phenomenon in any cellular context, as I believe investigating different perspectives can bring answers to our scientific questions. I hope to aid the Kim Lab’s efforts to unravel the molecular, genetic, and pathologic mysteries behind Tickborne Rickettsial Disease. My free time is dedicated to my family, as I could not have made strides as a person and scientist without their compassion and care. <br></br>E-mail: <a class="link">yarim.lee at stonybrook.edu</a></li>
